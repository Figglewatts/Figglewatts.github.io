**Hi, I'm Sam.** I'm a Software Engineer working in Cyber Security that lives in the UK.

I'm most well known for my project [LSD: Revamped](http://lsdrevamped.net), which aims to recreate the PlayStation game [LSD: Dream Emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD_(video_game)) in the Unity game engine. At the time of writing the game has over 40,000 downloads and I'm working on a new version. I've reverse engineered almost all of the game's data, and I'm slowly hacking away at a binary analysis.

My areas of interest are:
- Game development
- Reverse engineering (binaries, file formats, network traffic... you name it)
- Big data
- Electronics and hardware in general (although I'm not very good!)

I tend to write code in:
- C#
- C++
- Python
- Java
- Go (nothing public, yet...)
