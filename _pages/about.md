**Hi, I'm Sam.** I'm a Computer Science student that lives in the UK and is heavily interested in game development and software architecture.

I've made a bunch of stuff before, but I'm most well known for my project [LSD: Revamped](http://lsdrevamped.net), which aimed to recreate the PlayStation game [LSD: Dream Emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FLSD_(video_game)) in the Unity game engine. At the time of writing the game has over 40,000 downloads and I'm working on a new version.

I'm proficient in the following languages:
* C#
* Java
* Python
* C++

And my key skills are in:
* Software Engineering
* Software Reverse-Engineering
* Game Development
* Agile
* Object-Oriented Programming
